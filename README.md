2. Set up your ESP32 with the Arduino IDE.
3. Modify the code with your Wi-Fi credentials and OpenWeather API key.
4. Upload the code to the ESP32 and power it on.
5. Access the weather station's web interface to configure and monitor the system.

## Libraries Required
- DHT sensor library
- ESPAsyncWebServer
- NTPClient
- U8g2lib

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

### 1. **Wi-Fi Connection Issues**
   - **Problem:** ESP32 is unable to connect to Wi-Fi.
   - **Solution:** 
     - Ensure that the SSID and password in the code match your router's details.
     - If you're using the web interface to set the Wi-Fi, double-check the Wi-Fi credentials you've entered.
     - Make sure your Wi-Fi router supports 2.4 GHz (ESP32 may not connect to 5 GHz networks).
     - Check for any special characters in the SSID or password that may cause issues.

   - **How to Debug:**
     - Use the `Serial.println()` statements to print the Wi-Fi status and error messages.
     - Add debugging messages like:
       ```cpp
       Serial.print("Connecting to Wi-Fi...");
       if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
           Serial.println("Failed to connect");
       }
       ```
     - Open the Serial Monitor to see the connection status.

### 2. **DHT22 Sensor Not Working**
   - **Problem:** The temperature and humidity readings are incorrect or unavailable.
   - **Solution:**
     - Double-check the wiring of the DHT22 sensor. Ensure that the `VCC`, `GND`, and `DATA` pins are properly connected.
     - Ensure you're using the correct pin in the code for the DHT22 sensor.
     - Make sure you have the DHT library installed and updated in the Arduino IDE.
   
   - **How to Debug:**
     - Add debugging in the `loop()` function to check the sensor readings:
       ```cpp
       float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
       float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
       if (isnan(temperature) || isnan(humidity)) {
           Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
       } else {
           Serial.print("Temperature: ");
           Serial.print(temperature);
           Serial.print("Â°C, Humidity: ");
           Serial.print(humidity);
           Serial.println("%");
       }
       ```
     - Check the Serial Monitor for any error messages related to the sensor.

### 3. **OpenWeather API Issues**
   - **Problem:** Weather data is not being displayed or fetched.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure that the OpenWeather API key is valid and correctly entered in the code or the web interface.
     - Make sure that the city name in the code or entered in the web form is correct and matches the format expected by OpenWeather.
     - Verify that you have an active internet connection.
   
   - **How to Debug:**
     - Print the HTTP request status code to ensure the request to OpenWeather is successful:
       ```cpp
       if (httpCode == HTTP_OK) {
           // Successfully fetched data
       } else {
           Serial.print("Error on HTTP request: ");
           Serial.println(httpCode);
       }
       ```
     - Check the Serial Monitor for the HTTP status codes and error messages.

### 4. **OLED Display Not Showing Data**
   - **Problem:** The OLED screen is blank or not displaying the correct information.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure the OLED screen is correctly connected to the ESP32. Check the SDA and SCL pins in the code and make sure they match the actual connections.
     - Verify that the `U8g2lib` library is properly installed and up-to-date.
     - Make sure that the ESP32 is powered correctly and that there is no issue with the power supply.
   
   - **How to Debug:**
     - Print debug information to the Serial Monitor to check if the data is being fetched and processed correctly, but not displayed.
     - Try running a basic example code from the `U8g2lib` library to test the OLED display functionality.

### 5. **Web Interface Not Loading**
   - **Problem:** The ESP32 web interface does not load in the browser.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure that your device is connected to the same network as the ESP32.
     - Check if the IP address displayed in the Serial Monitor is correct.
     - Try accessing the web interface via `http://<ESP32_IP>`.

   - **How to Debug:**
     - Print the IP address of the ESP32 to the Serial Monitor to make sure it's correct:
       ```cpp
       Serial.print("IP Address: ");
       Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
       ```
     - Check if the web server code is running correctly. You can add a simple `Serial.println()` to confirm that the server has started:
       ```cpp
       server.on("/", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request) {
           Serial.println("Handling web request...");
           // Your code here
       });
       ```
     - Check if there are any issues with your router's firewall settings that might block access to the ESP32.

### 6. **General Debugging Tips**
   - **Problem:** General issues not covered above.
   - **Solution:**
     - Always check the Serial Monitor for error messages or debug output.
     - Add `Serial.println()` statements throughout the code to narrow down where the issue occurs.
     - Make sure your ESP32 board is selected correctly in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev Module).
     - Ensure the correct COM port is selected in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Port).
